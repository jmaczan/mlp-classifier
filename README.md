[Neural network implementation](nn.py)

## Report

### Neuron

It accepts list of variables as an input. Those variables are being multiplied by corresponding weights. The result of multiplication is summed and provided as an input to the activation function, which calculates an output number

### Perceptron

It's a neural network build with a single neuron

### Neural network

Consists of multiple neurons

### Layer

Layer is a group of neurons

Layers between input and output layers are called hidden layers

### First layer - input layer

It is not counted as a layer in a network

Number of nodes in the first layer equals number of features in the input data

### Last layer - output layer

Number of nodes (variables) in output layer depends on type of desirted prediction

### Weight

It represents how a given feature is important  

### Bias

It is a starting value for given neuron
